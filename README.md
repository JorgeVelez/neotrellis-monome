## What is it?



## mext

The mext protocol is used for serial communication - the same that is used in most recent monome devices.


## serialosc / libmonome

`serialosc` is required for serial communication with MacOS/Windows computers and OSC devices. Linux may use `serialosc` or `libmonome` depending on the application. `libmonome` is basically driver code which also facillitates monome serial communication.

You can get both `serialosc` and `libmonome` code from [monome github page](https://github.com/monome), and building them is well documented on official linux docs (they work for macOS as well), read part *2 Preparing your system: serialosc* (ignoring the `sudo apt-get` - I was missing `liblo`, but it's available on homebrew): [monome.org/docs/linux/](https://monome.org/docs/linux/).
